# ISGE
- Interactive Storytelling Games Environment
- started out as part of PUT Internet Applications course, though the idea grew further

# What is it?
**universal**, **easy-to-use** evironment to provide **freedom** to **quickly** create various kinds of storytelling Games

# The way to progress
Text-based -> GUI

1. JSON representation of the story (game)
2. load/save
3. web interface
4. builder (possibly Scratch-like drag-and-drop)

If the idea takes off and there are people interested, may consider scaling up to GUI, mobile, expanding, etc.
