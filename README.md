# ISGE
- Interactive Storytelling Games Environment
- started out as part of PUT Internet Applications course, though the idea grew further

# What is it?
**universal**, **easy-to-use** evironment to provide **freedom** to **quickly** create various kinds of storytelling Games

# NOTE
Given my current workload, I won't be able to pursue the project in the near future. If you find the idea interesting, I'm open to talks and collaboration. I can provide you with the whole cocneptual design to implement, or talk out possible changes in approach. Contact me by email: s.bujowski@gmail.com

# The way to progress
Text-based -> GUI

1. JSON representation of the story (game)
2. load/save
3. web interface
4. builder (possibly Scratch-like drag-and-drop)

If the idea takes off and there are people interested, may consider scaling up to GUI, mobile, expanding, etc.

# Explanation of how it came to be
From the teacher's description:

> Write an engine for a text-based in-browser rpg using React.js.
> - The storyline should be provided in a single file in json format of your design.
> - The engine should support at minimum:
>	  - progressing the story forward
>	  - events involving choice (which lead to different parts of the story, side quests, etc.),
>	  - actions with random chances of success *(though not necessarily - can be deterministic)*
>	  - *(More features are welcome)*
> - The app should have at least some styling.
> - Provide an awesome storyline to demonstrate the full potential of your engine :-D Seriously! No story, no points :-) I hope youâ€™ll have fun!

Though my thinking shifted more toward deterministic Storytelling (think of Detective Games, Horror Games, etc.). It didn't take long to notice the idea has much more potential - many Games Genres share similar needs regarding the environment.

Thus, it would make sense to create a **universal, easy-to-use** evironment to **quickly** create Games - not necessarily RPG's, rather give a **freedom** to create various kinds of Games.
